<p>
Each audio example below features the sonification of a transcription (left channel) and the corresponding recorded performance (right channel). The sonifications were produced using the unedited MIDI output from our best performing SampleGuitar AMT model. The dates in brackets next to the piece titles indicate when the original recording was recorded or released. In the 1928 "Danza Paraguaya" the guitar was not tuned to A440, so the recorded guitar and sonification (in A440) are out of tune with each other---it is notable that SampleGuitar was able to produce a coherent MIDI output on non-A440 audio.
