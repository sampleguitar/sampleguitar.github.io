Each audio example below features the sonification of a transcription (left channel) and the corresponding recorded performance (right channel). The sonifications were produced using the unedited MIDI output from our best performing SampleGuitar AMT model. The dates in brackets next to the piece titles indicate when the original recording was recorded or released.
